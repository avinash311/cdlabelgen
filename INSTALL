Install - Installation guide for cdlabelgen

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The basic step to install cdlabelgen on a Unix system as root user is:
	make install
or
        rpm -Uvh cdlabelgen-n.n.n-n.noarch.rpm
                 (use appropriate file version n.n.n-n)

'man cdlabelgen' will show you the documentation for cdlabelgen.
Or, use the pre-made cdlabelgen.html to view the  man page.


=head1 NOTES

If you prefer not to 'install' cdlabelgen, it will function perfectly
well as long as 'postscript/template.ps' is in your current working
directory (See @where_is_the_template in cdlabelgen to find out all
the places that cdlabelgen looks for its template by
default). cdlabelgen needs the template.ps file located in
./postscript/ to function properly, and 'make install' will put
template.ps in /usr/local/lib/cdlabelgen/ by default.
On Windows NT, the c:\cdlabelgen folder is used.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you're installing cdlabelgen on a non-Unix system, it I<should>
work just fine, but your mileage may vary. cdlabelgen has been
installed and tested on Slackware Linux.
