=head1 DESCRIPTION

cdlabelgen's purpose in life is twofold:

=over

=item * To be run automatically and swiftly from a shell script and
automatically generate a frontcard and a traycard for a cd--usually
data archive cd's. The traycard (which goes behind the CD itself) is
U-shaped and the ends of the CD case bear the label of what the CD is.
Inside inserts for DVDs are also supported.

=item * To have a minimum of dependencies--cdlabelgen only requires perl.

=back

cdlabelgen was designed to simplify the process of generating labels
for CD's. It originated as a program to allow auto generation of
frontcards and traycards for CD's burned via an automated mechanism
(specifically for archiving data), but has now become popular for
labelling CD compilations of mp3's, and copies of CDs. Note that
cdlabelgen does not actually print anything--it just spits out
postscript, which you can then do with as you please. It can also be
combined with output from other programs such as "barcodegen" - to print
a barcode as a tray overlay image.

The latest version of cdlabelgen as well as this document can be
found at http://www.aczoom.com/tools/cdinsert/. The software package
includes CGI scripts that can be used to serve cdlabelgen over the
internet.
An older version may be available at:
http://www.red-bean.com/~bwf/software/cdlabelgen/.

cdlabelgen comes with several eps images for you to use on your
labels. These images can be found in /usr/local/lib/cdlabelgen or
/usr/share/cdlabelgen or /opt/lib/cdlabelgen/ or
/usr/local/share/cdlabelgen, depending on your installation. Included
are a Recycling icon, an mp3 icon, the Compact Disc icon (with and
without 'Digital' on it), Tux the penguin, and the new Debian 'swirl'
logo. Two color background images called Music Notes are also
available.

CDs: cdlabelgen prints a 'tongue' as part of the
traycard. This folds around and is viewable from the front in jewel
boxes that are entirely clear (CD holder piece is not opaque). If you
do not have a clear CD holder in your jewel box, you may find it
easier to just cut the 'tongue' off--it's a bit easier to fold without
it.

Paper Sizes: Normal CD cases, Slim CD cases, DVD inside inserts
can be printed on a letter or A4 sized page.
CD/DVD Envelopes and DVD outside inserts will not fit on a
letter sized paper, a larger paper size will be needed to make it fit.

cdlabelgen requires Perl Version 5.003 or greater. Ghostscript is not
required, but B<is> recommended so that you can test out your labels
without wasting paper.

=head1 SWITCHES

=over

=item B<-c, --category <category>>

Set the category (title) for the CD

=item B<-s, --subcategory <subcategory>>

Set the subcategory (subtitle) for the CD

=item B<-i, --items <items>>

'items' should be a '%' separated list of items to print on the
traycard of the CD.  Note that if the number of items are too many
to fit on the tray card, cdlabelgen will leave out some items at the end.
cdlabelgen automatically flows the items into 2, 3, 4, or 5 columns
and scales the fontsize accordingly, unless the C<-P> option is used.
You can insert blank lines by
inserting 2 percent signs in a row into the items list.

=item B<-f, --items-from-file <filename>>

Get item names from file named filename. Each item should be on its
own line separated by carriage returns. 
cdlabelgen automatically flows the items into 2, 3, 4, or 5
columns and scales the fontsize or clips the items as needed.
You can insert blank lines by placing blank lines between items in this file.

Special commands can be embedded in the file, all of these commands
should be present starting at the first column of the line.
The codes are used to change the font for an item, the code itself is not
printed in the output.

 {#BI}     - make the item bold and italic
 {#I}      - make the item italic
 {#B}      - make the item bold
 {#M}      - make the item mono-spaced (Courier font)
 {#MB}     - make the item monospaced and bold (Courier-Bold font)

Example:

 {#MB}    Text 1 Item
would print the line "    Text 1 Item" in a monospaced bold font.

=item B<-v, --cover-items <number_of_items_for_cover>>

Normally, all the items are printed on the tray card.
But if you have a large number of items, you may wish to print some items
on the cover, and rest on the tray card.
This option provides a way of specifying how many items should be printed
on the cover. Default is 0 (i.e., print no item on the cover, print all
items on the tray). The items to be printed on the cover are taken from
the list of items, from the top of the list.
Note that if the number of items is too many to fit on the cover,
it will result in items being dropped. As of Jan 2002, around
250-300 items can be fitted on the cover or the tray, depending on
whether a title/subtitle/date is used or not.

=item B<-d, --date <date>>

Set the date to be used as 'date' if not set or not overridden with
the B<-D> flag, today's date will be used (default is today's
date). Use this option if you don't like cdlabelgen's default format of
YYCC-MM-YY, for example.

=item B<-D, --no-date> 

Do not print B<any> date (overrides B<-d> as well)

=item B<-e, --cover-image <cover_epsfile>>

Filename of eps file to print on cover. Note that cdlabelgen requires
that the eps file contain a proper '%%BoundingBox LLx LLy URx URy'
declaration according to the PostScript Document Structuring
Conventions. cdlabelgen uses this line to determine the dimensions of
the eps graphic so that it can position it appropriately on the
cover. Note that cdlabelgen first looks for this file in your working
directory. If it doesn't find it there, it will look in the list of
directories where the default eps files are stored (see
@where_is_the_template). This makes it easy to use the images shipped
with cdlabgelgen without typing miles of pathnames.

=item B<-S, --cover-image-scaleratio <cover_eps_scaleratio [,image_x_offset,image_y_offset_inches]>>

The ratio by which you want to scale the epsfile that appears on the
cover. If you omit this flag, cdlabelgen assumes a scaleratio of
1.0. This flag allows you to squeeze larger graphics into the cover or
expand smaller graphics to fill the cover. Scaleratio must be a number
(int or float). 

If the scale value passed is 0 (or 0.0), then the
logo is used as a background image - it will be scaled as required
to fit the entire cover.

The -S option also takes optional translate arguments.
Normally images are printed on the cover and the tray so that the
bottom-right of the image is anchored to the bottom-right of the cover or
tray. To move the images away from the bottom and right borders, use this
option. For example, to leave two inches of gap between the image and the
bottom border, and 0.5 inches from the left border, and use 1.0
scaleratio, use this: B<-S 1.0,-2,0.5>

This offset only applies when the image is being used as a logo - i.e.,
image is not being used as background to fill the entire cover or tray.

=item B<-E, --tray-image <tray_epsfile>>

Filename of eps file to print on traycard. Note that cdlabelgen
requires that the eps file contain a proper '%%BoundingBox LLx LLy URx
URy' declaration according to the PostScript Document Structuring
Conventions. cdlabelgen uses this line to determine the dimensions of
the eps graphic so that it can position it appropriately on the
cover. Note that cdlabelgen first looks for this file in your working
directory. If it doesn't find it there, it will look in the list of
directories where the default eps files are stored (see
@where_is_the_template). This makes it easy to use the images shipped
with cdlabgelgen without typing miles of pathnames.


=item B<-T, --tray-image-scaleratio <tray_eps_scaleratio [,image_x_offset,image_y_offset_inches]>>

The ratio by which you want to scale the epsfile that appears on the
traycard. If you omit this flag, cdlabelgen assumes a scaleratio of
1. This flag allows you to squeeze larger graphics into the traycard or
expand smaller graphics to fill the traycard. Scaleratio must be a 
positive number (int or float) specifying the scale.

If the scale value passed is the word B<fill1>, then the image is used as a
background - it is scaled so that it completely fills the interior tray
card region.  The value B<0> (or 0.0) works same as the
B<fill1> argument.

If the value passed is the word B<fill2>, then the image is used as a
background to fill more than just the tray.
For normal CD cases, the image is scaled so that it completely fills
both the tray card
region, and the two endcaps (but not the extreme right-hand 'tongue-cap')
for normal cd cases.
For Slim CD cases or DVD Inside/Outside covers, the tray image will fill
both the tray and cover regions (including any spines).
For directly printing on a CD (--create-cdlabel), fill2
option works like the fill1 option.

The -T option also takes optional translate arguments.
Normally images are printed on the cover and the tray so that the
bottom-right of the image is anchored to the bottom-right of the cover or
tray. To move the images away from the bottom and right borders, use this
option. For example, to leave two inches of gap between the image and the
bottom border, and 0.5 inches from the left border, and use 1.0
scaleratio, use this: B<-T 1.0,-2,0.5>

This offset only applies when the image is being used as a logo - i.e.,
image is not being used as background to fill the entire cover or tray.

=item B<-o, --output-file <outputfile>>

If the B<-o> flag is used, cdlabelgen prints to outputfile instead of STDOUT. 

=item B<-t, --template <template>>

Specify explicitly which template to use. This is useful if you need
to debug the PostScript code in the
template, use a different template, or if you have created
your own template to use in lieu of the one provided with
cdlabelgen.

=item B<-b, --no-tray-plaque>

Suppresses printing of the Plaque on the traycard, thus allowing you
to either fit even more items on the traycard, or to use a slightly 
larger font size for the items.

=item B<-C, --no-cover-plaque>

Suppresses printing of the plaque on the front cover, thus allowing 
a cover image that fills the front cover, but still displaying category
and sub-category information in the other usual places.

=item B<-h, --help>

print out the usage message

=item B<-w, --tray-word-wrap>

Enables word wrapping of the items that print on the traycard. Note
that this is *not* extensively tested and may be buggy! Make sure that
you preview your label before printing it if you use this flag.

If there is a problem with C<-w>, the best option right now is to split
lines in the input itself, and to omit the C<-w> option.

=item B<-m, --slim-case>

Creates covers suitable for use in slim cd-cases, this means
no tray card (the tray card is now the inside front cover). 
This creates a two page, folding cover insert. This could also be
used in normal cd cases as an inside insert.

Slim case option can be used with outside dvd inserts
( --create-dvd-outside ) also - in which case the outside insert
is created for half-height DVD case.

=item B<-O, --outside-foldout>

Output slim cd cover cases (or dvd inserts) with the order of the
pages switched so the folding line lies on the outside
of a normal case. Can be used when printing either the slim-cd-case or
dvd-inside inserts.

This option is best used along with option -m (--slim-case) or
--create-dvd-inside.

=item B<--rotate-endcaps>

Endcap text is rotated by 180 degrees, to flip the text around.

=item B<-M, --create-envelope>

Creates covers suitable for use as envelopes for a CD. Guide lines
are printed, to aid in folding the printout correctly.

=item B<--create-dvd-inside>

Creates inserts suitable for use as inside insert for a normal DVD case.
Guide lines are printed, to aid in folding the printout correctly.
Note: DVD inserts may not print fully on Letter or A4 sized paper
printers; it may require larger paper sizes.

=item B<--create-dvd-outside>

Creates inserts suitable for use as outside cover inserts
for a normal DVD case.
Guide lines are printed, to aid in folding the printout correctly.
Note: DVD inserts may not print fully on Letter or A4 sized paper
printers; it may require larger paper sizes.

Slim case option ( --slim-case ) can be used with outside dvd inserts
also - in which case the outside insert is created for half-height DVD case.

=item B<--double-case>

Create covers for double-sided DVD cases that hold 6 DVDs.
Only double-width DVD cases are supported, double-width CD cases are not
supported.
Therefore, using --double-case also implies the --create-dvd-outside option.
Note: DVD inserts may not print fully on Letter or A4 sized paper
printers; it may require larger paper sizes.

=item B<--slim-double-case>

Create covers for double-sided DVD cases that hold 6 DVDs in boxes 1.5 times the 
depth of normal dvd cases.
Only DVD cases are supported with this option, slim-double-width CD cases are not
supported.
Therefore, using --slim-double-case also implies the --create-dvd-outside option.
Note: DVD inserts may not print fully on Letter or A4 sized paper
printers; it may require larger paper sizes.

=item B<--create-cdlabel>

For directly printing on a CD or DVD. As of January 2005, there are
inkjets printers that can print on certain types of blank CD/DVD discs.
Only a small number of items can be printed on the CD, and the number of
characters in the title and subtitle is also limited.
Always check the output visually by using PostScript viewers or printing
on paper, before printing on the CD.

With this option, the top portion of the disc represents the "cover" area -
so arguments related to the cover:
title (--category), subtitle (--subcategory), --no-cover-plaque,
--cover-items, --cover-image, etc all apply to the top area.
The bottom portion of the disc represents the "tray" area, so arguments
related to the tray:
--no-tray-plaque, --tray-image, etc all apply to the bottom area.
The date (--date) string, if present, is printed along the bottom curved
edge of the disc.

Background images can be specified using the --cover-image option, 
modified as need by the --cover-image-scaleratio.
If --tray-image is also specified, note that the cover image is printed
first, then the tray image overwrites the cover image. The title/items text
is then finally printed over all the images.

The --no-tray-plaque and/or --no-cover-plaque (along with
--cover-items) option is also recommended with --create-cdlabel,
otherwise there may be no space for any items to be printed on the disc.

The --clip-items option is also recommended.

=item B<-p, --clip-items>

Enables clipping of items; uses fixed font size for all items.
Normally, the template.ps used by cdlabelgen will try to fit an
item in a given column by reducing the font size if needed. This is
ok if done for one or two items, but if done too often, it makes the
tray card look ugly, with text of varying font sizes. 

Use this option to use a fixed width font for all items. If the item
is too large to fit in a column, the text will be clipped instead.

=item B<-y, --page-offset [<page_x_offset_inches,]<page_y_offset_inches>

Use this to move the entire output up or down (y_offset), to make the
output fit on appropriate sized paper. For letter sized paper,
0.8 works well, and for
A4 paper, 1.5 works well. The value is in units of inches.
An optional X-axis offset can also be specified.
Default values: 1 inch for X-axis, 0.8 inches for Y-axis.

=item B<-l, --line-width <line_width_points>>

Specify size in points of 
the edge and interior lines of the cover and tray card.
If this is 0, then the lines are omitted for both the cover and tray
(but guide cut lines are still printed). The size is specified in points
(1 point is 1/72 inch).

=item B<--plaque-color <r,g,b>>

Specify a color to fill plaque.
Color must be specified using the rgb components, each value
should be between 0 and 255.

=item B<--category-color <r,g,b>>

Specify a color for category.
Color must be specified using the rgb components, each value
should be between 0 and 255.

=item B<--subcategory-color <r,g,b>>

Specify a color for subcategory.
Color must be specified using the rgb components, each value
should be between 0 and 255.

=item B<--text-color <r,g,b>>

Specify a color for text - this is used for the list of items, and the
date display under the plaque and in the end-caps.
Color must be specified using the rgb components, each value
should be between 0 and 255.

=item B<-n, --number-in-set <string>>

Append volume information to the end of the date string.  This should
be a single string.  If used in conjuction with C<-D>, it will be in
place of the date; otherwise, it is appended to the date as " -
<number-in-set>"

=item B<--rows-columns <row_count_for_items,column_count_for_items>>

The --rows-columns options forces the list of items to be printed using
that many rows, and that many columns.
Both numbers have to be provided, no spaces, for example:
--rows-columns=11,3

The list of items is laid out in top-down, left-to-right fashion.
Use blank items in the input, to get appropriately aligned columns. 

--rows-columns applies to the list of items wherever they are printed - normally
on the tray only, but may include cover, or the top and bottom portions
of the round printouts for direct CD label printing.
Same values apply to all these variations,
so if you need different number of rows/columns for cover vs
tray, you can use two different runs of cdlabelgen, to get two postscript
files, and pick the cover from one printout, and tray from the other.
This will work for jewel-case inserts, but may not work for direct CD
label printing.

=item B<--tray-overlay overlay_epsfile>

Filename of eps file to print as overlay on traycard. This image
is printed over the background image (tray-image) as well as the list 
of items. Therefore, this is useful for things like barcodes.
In terms of EPS file requirements, see the --tray-image option
description.

=item B<--tray-overlay-scaleratio tray_overlay_image_scaleratio[,image_x_offset,image_y_offset_inches]>

The ratio by which you want to scale the epsfile that is used with the
--tray-overlay option, and optionally to translate the overlay.
Normally overlay image is printed on the tray so that the
bottom-right of the image is anchored to the bottom-right of the
tray. To move the images away from the bottom and right borders, use this
option. For example, to leave 0.1 inches of gap between the image and the
bottom border, and 0.2 inches from the right border, and use 1.0
scaleratio (no scaling), use this: B<--tray-overlay-scaleratio 1.0,-0.2,0.1>

=head1 EXAMPLES

    cdlabelgen -c "My Filesystem" 
                 -s "/usr/local/foo"
		 -e postscript/recycle.eps > foo.ps

    cdlabelgen -c "title of cd"
                 -s "subtitle"

		 -o qux.ps


    cdlabelgen -c "Backups"
                 -s "home directory"
		 -n "4 of 5"

    Direct printing on a CD or DVD, if file "example5.txt" has list of items:
    cdlabelgen --clip-items --no-tray-plaque --date "Jan 2005"
      -c "Collections 12" -s "- english songs -"
      --cover-image "music2.eps" --cover-image-scaleratio 0.0
      --tray-image "mp3.eps" --tray-image-scaleratio 0.5,-0.5,2
      --page-offset 0.5,0.5 -f example5.txt -o test.ps

=head1 CHARACTER ENCODINGS - using ogonkify

cdlabelgen uses the Helvetica family of fonts for various text items,
using the default encoding of ISO-Latin1.

To use other encodings, the "ogonkify" program can be used; this is a
package available at http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/ogonkify/
The output from cdlabelgen can be piped into ogonkify, example for Latin2
encoding:

   cdlabelgen <args>  | ogonkify -H -eL2    > <outputfilename>

See the man page for ogonkify for other possible values for the encoding.

Hint: if you always work with a particular encoding, you can just
run ogonkify on template.ps - and use the output as the new template.ps.

   ogonkify -H -eL2 template.ps > template-enc.ps

This way ogonkify has to be run only once, cdlabelgen output will
contain the correctly encoded fonts from the modified template.ps. Use
the -t cdlabelgen option to specify the new template-enc.ps file, or save
the old template.ps and renmae template-enc.ps to template.ps.

=head1 PRINTING

When using tools such as Adobe Acrobat to print the .ps or a .pdf file,
make sure that "Fit To Paper" option is unchecked.
Also uncheck any option that will perform scaling up or down of the
cdlabelgen output file.

Failure to do so will result in incorrect size printouts.

Paper Sizes: Normal CD cases, Slim CD cases, DVD inside inserts
can be printed on a letter or A4 sized page.
CD/DVD Envelopes and DVD outside inserts will not fit on a
letter sized paper, a larger paper size will be needed to make it fit.

When using different sized paper, experimentation with the 
B<-y> (also: B<--page-offset>) [<page_x_offset_inches,]<page_y_offset_inches>
option 
may be required to place the image in the printable region of the paper.
